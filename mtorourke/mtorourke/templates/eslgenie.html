	<div>ESL Genie is an interactive, intelligent system for learning and teaching English and a second language on the web. It was created as a research project at UCSD, in order to give students a learning tool and learn about the way in which language learners acquire grammar. I participated in this project as both a developer and a language specialist. This meant writing code for the website as well as transcribing essays and generating educational and research-relatd content. ESL Genie was the very first software development project that I have ever worked on. </div>
